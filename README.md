## Xiao Hanyu

I consider myself as a polyglot fullstack engineer that can do anything about
web development, given enough time.

I love open source and speaks JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Clojure, etc.

I am right now working on my first commercial project,
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=xiaohanyu/xiaohanyu),
which is a LaTeX-based resume builder that helps people create beautifully
typeset resumes in minutes.
